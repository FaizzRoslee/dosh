However, most human volunteers exposed to 50 ppm experienced mild irritation while those exposed to 200 ppm developed conjunctivitis. Irritation of the upper respiratory tract was reported to occur at exposure levels of 134-200 ppm. Acetaldehyde is also classified in EPA\'s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) to be a known or suspected carcinogen. PEL values seem to vary among agencies and most countries.

A study conducted by a Swedish team (Ernstgard et. al, 2006)  suggests a mild irritating effect at 10 ppm. Workers at Eastman Kodak showed no irritation or other health effects when exposed to levels of acetic acid in excess of 15 ppm and reported that exposure at 20-30 ppm was not harmful.

Although respiratory effects have been observed in workers exposed to aluminium dust, most exposures have been found to be contributed by other chemicals as well as aluminium. Following inhalation, most insoluble aluminum salts are retained in the lung, while soluble salts are slowly absorbed into the blood. HSE cited that animals demonstrated some lung effects, but not fibrosis, at exposures in the range of  20-100 mg/m3. This is supported by Gross et al. who reported that animals exposed to aluminium powders at concentrations of 15, 30, 50 or 100 mg/m3, 6 hours daily, 5 days/week for 6 months experienced alveolar proteinosis. In view of the fact that there is no evidence for effects in humans at exposure levels below 20 mg/m3, the UK  has set a TWA of 10 mg/m3 for total inhalable dust, 4 mg/m3 for respirable dust,  2 mg/m3 for soluble aluminum salts and 2 mg/m3 for aluminum alkyls.

A study by Kennedy et. al reported that the no-observed-effect level was 1 mg/m3 and a mean organofluoride blood level of 13 ppm was detected in rats immediately after the tenth exposure to an atmospheric level of 1 mg ammonium perfluorooctanoate/m3.

Exposure to concentrations of 7-53 ppm aniline vapour showed slight symptoms of cyanosis after several hours. A 1-hour inhalation exposure to concentrations of 100-160 ppm aniline is said to cause severe effects such as shortness of breath, headache and dizziness. It was also reported that exposures ranging from 50-100 ppm can probably be tolerated for about 1 hour. While evidence for carcinogenicity in humans is inadequate and that there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, as reported by the IARC  (International Agency for Research on Cancer),  ACGIH considers aniline as an A3, animal carcinogen. Since systemic effects have been observed in humans exposed to as low as 7 ppm and, in animals to levels as low as 5 ppm, a TWA of 2 ppm is deemed a reasonable value. Moreover PEL values seem to vary among most countries and in view of its usefulness in industries, a TWA of 2 ppm, as supported by ACGIH, is recommended as the Malaysian PEL. This limit is based on the risk of methemoglobinemia associated with exposure to the compound. Moderate skin irritation and sensitization and dermatitis have also been reported, hence a skin notation is warranted.

Mice exposed to  2-6 ppm anisidine (isomer unspecified) for 2 hours daily for a year developed anemia and reticulocytosis. o-Anisidine (tested as the hydrochloride) was carcinogenic in rats and mice after oral exposure. It can be assumed that the carcinogenic effect of o-anisidine hydrochloride after oral administration is due to o-anisidine itself. In a related 28 day study, rats exposed to 0, 16, 80 or  400 mg/kg showed a no-observed-adverse-effect-level of 16 mg/kg/day, but at doses of 80 mg/kg, yellow urine and faint haemolytic anaemia were observed. Based on sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of o-anisidine, NIOSH considers the compound to be a potential occupational carcinogen, 2B. Exposure to o-anisidine should therefore be limited to the lowest possible concentration and a TWA of 0.1 ppm (500 times less than IDLH concentration) is deemed appropriate.

Incidently these workers were also exposed to low concentrations of arsenic (0.39-1.10 mg/m3), a common contaminant. In another study, 51 smelters exposed to high concentrations of sparingly soluble antimony compounds (9-31 years) were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Measured dust concentrations ranged from 17-86 mg/m3. Six of 124 workers died suddenly and two died of chronic heart disease when exposed to antimony trisulfide at air concentrations ranging from 0.6-5.5 mg/m3 for 8-24 months. Acute inhalation exposure of humans may cause gastrointestinal disorders, probably due to ingestion of airborne antimony. Animals exposed to high concentrations (1395 mg Sb/m3 for 30 minutes) of antimony and compounds (especially stibine gas) may result in pulmonary edema and death. Rats exposed  to 4.2 or 36 mg Sb/m3 as antimony trioxide or 17.48 mg Sb/m3 as antimony trisulfide for 1 year showed an increase in lung tumour.

In the UK, epidemiological studies (1973 and earlier) of heavily exposed production workers showed increased rates of lung cancer. A report by The Nordic Expert Group indicated that exposure of antimony trioxide below 0.5 mg/m3 has not been shown to give rise to pulmonary changes as observed on lung X-rays, while transitory skin ulcerations may be observed where the dust penetrates sweat ducts. Hence, apparently at a level of 0.5 mg/m3 or lower there is no increased risk of pneumoconiosis or lung cancer. In animal studies, pneumonitis was observed in rats and rabbits exposed to 90-125 mg/m3 antimony trioxide for 100 hr/month for up to 14 months. In view of the uncertainties with respect to carcinogenicity of antimony trioxide  in humans, the UK has established a TWA of  0.5 mg/m3 as its PEL.

Workers exposed to 0.4-1 mg/m3 inorganic arsenic for 2 years or more showed hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratinization. Lung cancer is the critical effect following inhalation, with an increased incidence of lung cancer seen in several occupational groups, especially in mining and copper smelting workers. Chronic exposure has been associated with decreased birth weight and an increased rate of spontaneous abortion in female smelter workers. Several animal studies have shown an association between tumour induction and exposure to arsenic by inhalation or intratracheal instillation. Long-term inhalation exposures have caused altered conditioned reflexes and CNS damage. A TWA of 0.01 mg/m3 adopted by ACGIH and OSHA is a reasonable PEL value in view of its industrial usefulness, despite of being classified as carcinogenic.

Studies in humans and animals indicate that inhalation of asbestos fibres may lead to fibrotic lung disease (asbestosis), pleural plaques and thickening and cancer of the lung, pleura and peritoneum. An increased incidence of pleural plaques has been noted at relatively low cumulative exposures, about 0.12 f-yr/mL. Evidence for the role of asbestos in human lung cancer is obtained primarily from studies of the cause of death of occupationally-exposed workers. For example, the causes of death in a very large cohort of insulation workers (17,800 men) in the United States and Canada have been studied. Between 1967 and 1976, there were 2,271 deaths in this group, of which 486 were attributed to lung cancer. There is no doubt that inhalation of asbestos can lead to increased risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma. This finding has been conclusively demonstrated in numerous studies of occupationally exposed workers and has been confirmed in a number of animal experiments. Research has shown a clear link between exposure to asbestos and respiratory cancers, notably cancer of the lungs and mesothelioma in humans. In Malaysia, a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and type of respiratory conditions including asbestos-related diseases among 1164 asbestos cement workers reported 2 cases of asbestosis and a case of bronchial carcinoma. Currently since most agencies adopt a PEL-TWA of 0.1 f/ml, this value is recommended for the Malaysian PEL.

However, one spray-aircraft pilot experienced severe symptoms of azinphos-methyl poisoning while flying his craft. In a study of 8 workers who were dermally exposed to up to 9.6 mg/m3, the lowest activity of cholinesterase in the blood serum was 78% of the value before exposure, and there were no signs of illness.

Barium doses as low as 0.2-0.5 g (3-7 mg/kg body weight), generally resulting from the ingestion of barium chloride or carbonate, have been found to produce toxic effects in adult humans. The effect of barium dusts on welders was investigated under simulated working conditions over one week time period with concentrations of 4.4 and 2.0 mg/m3 during welding with stick electrodes and flux cored wires, respectively. No adverse health effects were noted to barium exposure, although there was a slight decrease in plasma potassium levels of the welders at the end of the work shift. Animal studies showed that exposure  of rats to an air concentration of 5.2 mg barium carbonate/m3 for 4 hours/day for 6 months resulted in an increased blood pressure. Exposure of male rats to 1.15 and 5.2 mg/m3 of barium carbonate dust for 4 hours/day for 6 months resulted in the high-dosed animals developing elevated arterial pressure, decreased body weight gain, decreased blood levels of haemoglobin, sugar, protein, cholinesterase and thrombocytes but increased blood levels of leukocytes.

In animals, rats exposed to 0, 10, 50 and 200 mg benomyl/m3 for 6 hours daily, 5 days/week for 14 weeks showed a degeneration of the olfactory epithelium at 50 and 200 mg/m3 after 45 days exposure. After  90 days all the rats showed olfactory degeneration at 200 mg/m3, along with three males exposed to 50 mg/m3. No other pathological effects were noted. A number of studies have demonstrated reproductive and teratogenic effects of benomyl in experimental animals. Rats fed with benomyl at relatively low doses of about 15 mg/kg/day for 70 days, had decreased sperm counts and testicular weight and had lower fertility rates. Benomyl is reported to have a low acute toxicity to mammals, with the LD50 being greater than 10,000 mg/kg in rats. The EPA, however, classifies benomyl as a possible human carcinogen based on studies in which test animals developed lung and liver cancers. In view of contadictory results, ACGIH has set a TWA of 10 mg/m3 and this limit is recommended.

Workers exposed to benzene concentrations of 30 and 150 ppm for 4 months-1 year had increased incidences of pancytopenia. In a group of patients exposed to 150-650 ppm benzene for 4 months-15 years severe blood dyscrasias were exhibited, and 8 of 32 died with thrombocytopenic hemorrhage and infection.

Chronic exposures of workers to benzene for 0.5-4 years showed EEG changes and atypical sleep activity consistent with neurotoxicity. Both the IARC and EPA have determined that benzene is carcinogenic to humans. Hence, exposure to benzene should be reduced to the lowest possible level.

Another study involving 697 male workers exposed to benzotrichloride, benzyl chloride and benzoyl chloride at a chlorination plant recorded 7 deaths from respiratory cancer. Five of these deaths occurred in workers employed for at least 15 years. In animals, inhalation exposure of  female mice to an average concentration of 6.8 ppm benzotrichloride (purity unspecified) twice weekly for 30 minutes for 5 months, followed by a 1- to 5-month observation period resulted in adverse effects such as lung adenomas, malignant lymphoma, skin carcinoma and skin papillomas.

The available human data for benzotrichloride alone are inadequate and a realistic exposure assessment of benzotrichloride is not possible since workers are exposed to other chlorinated chemicals. There is evidence that exposure to benzotrichloride (as well as other chemicals) in the production of chlorinated toluenes increases the risk of respiratory cancer. Most countries have not set a PEL value, ACGIH, however has set a ceiling limit of 0.1 ppm which is deemed appropriate for a toxic compound.

In a 4-hour exposure to 24,300 mg/m3 BPO, rats showed eye tearing, squinting, breathlessness, salivation, erythema and depression, but recovered when exposure was stopped.

Epidemiological evidence for human cancer from exposure to benzo[a]pyrene is found in studies of roofers, tar distillers, patent-fuel workers and creosote-exposed brickmakers. However, it is more difficult to link cancers to specific BaP sources since human exposure to BaP also occurs via smoking of cigarettes and inhalation of polluted air.

Apparently, a 20 ppm exposure renders the atmosphere irrespirable in 1 minute. Exposure to high concentrations also have effects on the central nervous system. Occupational exposure to 2 ppm benzyl chloride was reported to lead to neurological symptoms and liver dysfunction and these effects most likely reflect chronic exposure with unspecified duration of exposure.

Human epidemiology studies are limited, but suggest a relationship between Be exposure and an increased risk of lung cancer.

A NIOSH health hazard evaluations finding among workers revealed a dose-related and statistically significant increase in the frequency of eye irritation, cough, nose bleeds, sore throat and shortness of breath. Over 10% of employees with mean TWA exposures of 8.6 mg/m3 (measured as total tetraborate dust) experienced nose bleeds, cough, eye irritation and dryness of the mouth, nose or throat. At a mean exposure level of 14.6 mg/m3, between 15 and 30% reported the same symptoms. An additional study on 629 workers (employed for 5 years or more at a borax mining and production plant) exposed to 1.1, 4.0, 8.4 and 14.6 mg/m3 borax showed statistically positive dose-related trends for respiratory symptoms. As there was no indication that borax exposure at the levels studied impaired pulmonary function, it was concluded that borax appeared to have caused simple respiratory irritation that led to chronic bronchitis, with no impairment of respiratory function. Irritation was observed to occur primarily at concentrations of 4.4 mg/m3 borax or more. Since irritation effects occur above 4 mg/m3 and the permissible levels of the different forms of borates varies, it is recommended that the ACGIH TWA of 2 mg/m3 and a STEL of 6 mg/m3 be adopted.

The UK has established a TWA of 10 ppm, a reasonable value considering that this is 200 times less than the IDLH.

Exposure to vapours of tert-butyl chromate causes irritation of the upper respiratory tract and may result in ulceration of the nasal septum. Skin contact causes acid-like burns and necrotic lesions. Chronic exposure may lead to kidney or liver damage. Epidemiological studies of chromate production plants showed a correlation between occupational exposure to chromium and lung cancer although the specific form of chromium responsible for the induction of cancer was not identified. Rats exposed to 0.5 mg/m3 CrO2 (IV) 6 hours daily, 5 days/week for 2 years produced dust-laden alveolar macrophages with slight Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Mice exposed to 1.81 or 3.63 mg/m3 Cr(VI) as CrO3 for 1 year developed nasal septal perforation, loss of cilia, and lung, trachea and bronchus metaplasia. Long-term exposure to airborne chromium (VI) can have adverse effects on the respiratory and the immune systems and can cause cancer. ACGIH has set a ceiling of 0.1 ppm considering that chromium (VI) compounds have been found to be carcinogenic in animal studies. Hence, exposure to tert-butyl chromate should be regulated on the basis of a ceiling limit because of the potential for harmful effects from short exposure, and that these effects might not be controlled by an 8-hour average concentration. This limit is thus recommended. A skin notation is also added since skin contact may cause burns.

In rats and mice, a formulation of calcium cyanamide in the diet was not found to be carcinogenic in a 2-year National Toxicology Program study, although some mice did develop lymphomas and leukemia. In view of the limited data on the toxicity of calcium cyanamide in humans and the high acute oral and dermal toxicity demonstrated in laboratory animals, a TWA of 0.5 mg/m3 set by ACGIH is deemed reasonable. This TWA limit is recommended and a STEL of 1 mg/m3 is suggested too to substantially reduce the risks of  irritation, sensitizing dermatitis and vasomotor effects.

Exposure to caprolactam vapour/dust at about 61 mg/m3 caused rritability, nervousness, nosebleeds, irritation/inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, dry nose, abdominal gas and heartburn. Another study reported that exposure to caprolactam dust produced skin irritation, although no concentrations were given.

Kumagai & Matsunaga (1994) studied 10 workers exposed to chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene during synthesis of dye intermediates gave a predicted urinary concentration of 1.3 mg 4-chlorophenol /g  and 7 mg 4-chlorophenol/g creatinine after 8h exposure to 1ppm chlorobenzene[19].

TWA: 0.01 mg/m3','Chromium compounds are very toxic by inhalation and a single exposure causes severe damage to the respiratory tract. Repeated application to damaged skin is known to cause skin sensitisation and ulcers. Inhalation of water soluble compounds at 1-15 mg/m3 results in ulceration and perforation of the nasal septum, necrosis, emphysema, inflammation and cell structure changes in the respiractory tract. Chromium also is capable of causing lung tumours following inhalation and local tumours following injection in animals. Repeated exposure to soluble chromium in humans exhibited irritation and corrosion of the respiratory tract, nasal septum ulceration, inflammation, fibrosis, emphysema and ulceration of gastrointestinal tract. Nasal septum damage has been reported in workers exposed to 0.05 mg/m3. Ingestion and skin contact has led to systemic toxicity and death.  The PEL-TWA values adopted by most of the countries for chromium is deemed appropiate.

ACGIH has established two BEIs. The first BEI, reflective of both long-term and short-term exposure, is 25 ?g/g creatinine when the urine is collected at the end of the work-shift and end of the workweek. The second BEI for daily exposure is 10 ?g/g creatinine when calculated as the difference between a pre-workshift and a post-workshift urine collected on the same day. The value has been derived mostly from data on manual metal arc welding and the relationship between urinary chromium and inhalation of hexavalent chromium in water-soluble fume [22]. The value adopted as guidance in the UK is 10  micro mol/mol creatinine and is based on a survey of occupational exposure in workplaces with good control of exposure to chromium rather than a health-based value [ 29 ]. The recommended BEI is 25  micro g/L for total chromium in urine (end of shift), and 10  micro g/L for total chromium in urine (increase during shift):','ref [5] : NIOSH 7024\r\nClass : Fully validated\r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique : Atomic absorption, Flame\r\n\r\nref [6] : NIOSH  7300 \r\nClass : Partially validated \r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique : Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)\r\n\r\nref [7] : NIOSH  7301\r\nClass : Partially validated \r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique : Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICAP-AES)\r\n\r\nref [8] : NIOSH   7303\r\nClass : Partially validated \r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique :  Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)\r\n\r\nref [9] :NIOSH 9102 \r\nClass :Partially validated\r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique : Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)\r\n\r\nref [10] : OSHA ID121\r\nClass : Validated \r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique : Atomic Absorption or Emission Spectroscopy \r\n\r\nref [11] : OSHA ID125G\r\nClass : Validated \r\nMethod name : Spectroscopy\r\nTechnique :Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICAP-AES)','Chromium Metal and inorganic compounds, as Cr metal and Cr III compounds) :  Incompatibilities with strong oxidizers (such as hydrogen peroxide) and alkalis  [1] \n\nChromium (Chromile ore processing (Chromate), as Cr) & Chromium (Water soluble Cr VI compounds NOC)  :  The substance decomposes above 250°C to chromic oxide and oxygen, which increases fire hazard.

Cardiac irregularities, including complete heart block, may also occur [17]. Human exposure of dichlorvos for 30 minutes/hour each hour, 10 hours/day for 14 days at concentrations of 0.14 to 0.33 mg/m3 had no changes in cholinesterase levels, airway resistance, or vision. At a concentration of 1 mg/m3 for 7.5 to 8.5 hours, a 20- to 25-percent reduction in cholinesterase levels was experienced [18]. Workers exposed over a period of a year to an average concentration of 0.7 mg/m3 showed decreases of 35 percent and 60 percent, respectively, in red blood cell and plasma cholinesterase levels [17]. At a level of 0.1 ppm , the plasma cholinesterase is reported to drop by 20 percent [18].

Combination of disulfiram and alcohol can cause toxic effect related to elevated acetaldehyde levels or so called “Antabuse reaction”. It has been reported that small dose of disulfiram can cause a measurable effect on thyroid iodine uptake and also may cause throid gland hypertrophy [15]. Exposure to disulfiram can also cause aceform skin rashes, dermatitis, and urticaria [16]. Exposure to disulfiram followed by ingestion of alcohol causes syndromes that start with a sensation of heat, facial flushing, restlessness, and anxiety and progresses to palpitations, increased heart and respiratory rates hypertension, chest pain, sweating, nausea, vomiting, weakness, dizziness, and confusion. Severe reactions have included convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, marked respiratory depression, and acute congestive heart failure [17]. This syndrome has been observed in workers who has ingested alcohol and then been exposed to disulfiram and patients consumed disulfiram for medication purpose [18]. The signs and symptoms of acute exposure to disulfiram include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, impaired sexual functioning, a garlic or metallic taste in the mouth, mild gastrointestinal symptoms, depression, psychosis, and confusion. For the signs and symptoms of diculfiram-induced peripheral neuropathy include visual impairment, muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling. Skin contact with disulfiram may cause acneform eruptions, redness, swelling, scaling and itching. Chronic exposure to disulfiram may cause identical signs and symptoms to those associated with acute exposure. A PEL value of 2 mg/m(3) TWA is adopted for disulfiram.

One or more seizures have been reported among nine workers exposed to endosulfan while performing various tasks, including the bagging of a 50% water wettable endosulfan powder. These workers experienced a prodromal syndrome which includes malaise, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, confusion and headache. However, the recovery was found to occur within a few days [15, 16]. In sub-chronic exposure cases, a worker cleaning vats that contained endosulfan residues experienced malaise, fainting spells, and seizures after 4 months of exposure. This worker had three consecutive seizures that resolved after emergency medical treatment. Later, gross cognitive deficits and agitation were diagnosed and 2 years later, this worker continued to have memory impairment, nominal aphasia and poor viausl-motor coordication [17].

After inhalation, the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose, coughing, chest discomfort, difficult or short breath, and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with this chemical may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Direct eye contact will cause pain, bleeding, tears, pupil constriction, and blurred vision. Severe poisoning of ethion will affect the central nervous system, producing incoordination, slurred speech, loss of reflexes, weakness, fatigue, involuntary muscle contractions, twitching, tremors of the tongue or eyelids, and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases, involuntary defecation or urination, psychosis, irregular heart beats, unconsciousness, convulsions and coma may also occur. Death may be caused by respiratory failure or cardiac arrest [14].  A PEL of 0.4 mg/m(3) for ethion as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation is established. These limits will protect exposed workers from the significant risks of organophosphate poisoning and cholinesterase inhibition.

Based on PBPK model, Jang et al (2001) estimated the mandelic acid secretion of  1.73 g/g creatinine at 100 ppm exposure [21].The measurement of MA and PGA in urine appears to be an appropriate indicator of recent external exposure to ethylbenzene. According to several studies carried out in Germany, the ambient exposure to 23 ppm ethylbenzene corresponded to a urine concentration during the last 2 h of the exposure period of 220 mg MA/g creatinine. By extrapolating this result to higher exposure levels, it can be estimated that an exposure to the MAK of 100 ppm is associated with a urinary concentration of MA of 1 g/g creatinine at the end of the shift [22]. Germany established  BAT of 0.8 g/g MA. At TLV of 100 ppm, ACGIH established a BEI of 0.7 g/g creatinine mandelic acid and phenyl glyoxylic acid in urine.

For the determination of  urinary  F, the specimens from 142 healthy HF workers (aged 18 to 59) who had been engaged in washing glass bulbs for TV picture tubes and etching semiconductors were studied. These types of work were carried out continuously in a closed room in which HF was vaporized from several places. HF concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 5.0 ppm. Pre- and post-shift  urine samples were taken. The post-shift urinary F concentrations in HF workers were significantly higher than the pre-shift concentrations. A mean F concentration of 82.3 ug/L in serum and 4 mg/L in urine with a lower fiducial limit (95%, p = 0.05) of 2 mg/L in urine were estimated to correspond to an atmospheric HF concentration of 3 ppm [10]. At TLV of 2.5 mg/m3, ACGIH 2007 adopted a BEI of 3 mg/g  for fluorides in urine (prior to shift); and creatinine  10 mg/g creatinine for fluorides in urine (end of shift). The determinant may be present in biological specimens collected from subject who have not been occupationally exposed, at a concentration which could affect interpretation of the result.

Therefore, OSHA is temporarily delaying a final decision regarding the establishment of a separate PEL for fibrous glass; however, OSHA will make this final decision within a reasonable period of time.[ ]','','','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers','see Synthetic Vitreous Fibers',325,'2010-04-15 11:55:41',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Ackermann, Bassler, and Wagner (1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 286) have reported that glycerin mist is easily metabolized and excreted. In the adult human of average weight, 2 grams of glycerol can be metabolized and excreted in an 8-hour workday.

OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3 (total particulate) and retaining the 5-mg/m3 (respirable particulate) limit for glycerin mist.

(1,3,5). EPA has classified hexachlorobenzene as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen. (5). EPA uses mathematical models, based on animal studies to estimate the probability of a person developing cancer from breathing air containing a specified concentration of a chemical. EPA calculated an inhalation unit risk estimate of 4.6 x 10-4 (µg/m3)-1. EPA estimates that, if an individual were to continuously breathe air containing hexachlorobenzene at an average of 0.002 µg/m3 (2.0 x 10-6 mg/m3) over his or her entire lifetime, that person would theoretically have no more than a one-in-a-million increased chance of developing cancer as a direct result of breathing air containing this chemical. Similarly, EPA estimates that breathing air containing 0.02 µg/m3 (2.0 x 10-5 mg/m3) would result in not greater than a one-in-a-hundred thousand increased chance of developing cancer, and air containing 0.2 µg/m3 (2.0 x 10-4 mg/m3) would result in not greater than a one-in-ten thousand increased chance of developing cancer.

The Agency believes that the protection provided by NIOSH\'s 10-ppm short-term limit is essentially equivalent to that provided by OSHA\'s combined TWA-STEL limits, and that the combination of a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 15-ppm STEL established in the final rule will provide broader protection in workplaces characterized either by short-term or by steady-state exposures.   OSHA has accordingly established an 8-hour TWA limit for hydrogen sulfide of 10 ppm and a short-term limit of 15 ppm. These levels have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing irritation and conjunctivitis in the workplace (Poda and Aiken 1966/ Ex. 1-115). The Agency finds that this dual limit will provide protection both in continuous steady-state exposure situations and in those characterized by sharp peaks and will do so more effectively than a single, short-term limit such as that recommended by NIOSH.

First-order clearance models can be used with blood, breath, or urine concentrations to estimate exposures if the time that has elapsed since the exposure and the model parameters are known. Blood data gave a half-life of 1.44 ± 0.33 h. Comparable but slightly more variable results were obtained using urine data corrected for voiding time (1.55 ± 0.67 h) [21]. At TLV of 200 ppm, ACGIH 2007 established a BEI of 15 mg/l for methanol in urine. The determinant may be present in biological specimens collected from subject who have not been occupationally exposed, at a concentration which could affect interpretation of the result. Such background concentrations are incorporated in the BEI value. It is also non specific and is also observed after exposure to other chemicals.

Some workers exposed daily to concentartions averaging 195 to 475 ppm showed delayed signs, including weakness, drowsiness, staggering gait slurred speech, lapses of memory and cynosis.  Effects may last for a long period following exposure. No effects were seen in other workers exposed to 15 to 195 ppm. Frosbite may result from contact with the liquid.[16]\n OSHA\'s former limits for methyl chloride were 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, 200 ppm as a ceiling (not to be exceeded for more than five minutes in any three-hour period), and 300 ppm as a peak. The ACGIH has a 50-ppm 8-hour TLV-TWA limit and a 100-ppm 15-minute STEL for this substance, and NIOSH recommends the lowest feasible limit because it considers methyl chloride a potential occupational carcinogen. The proposed PELs are 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 100 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; the final rule establishes these limits.

Exposure to concentration in excess of 1000 ppm for 15 minutes, or 2000 ppm for 5 minutes, can be expected to produce a disturbance of equilibrium in the majority of adults. Above 1700 ppm, minor disturbances of equilibrium have been observed, with complaints of headache and lassitude.

Blood and expired air MC concentrations were proportional to the exposure concentration and indicated that about 25% of the MC inhaled during the 6-hr exposure was absorbed. Over 91% of the absorbed MC was excreted unchanged via the lungs, 5–6% was metabolized and excreted as TCE and TCA, and less than 1% remained in the body after 9 days. These data suggest that the kinetics of MC in man are essentially first order at or below the current TL V of 350 ppm [19].  50 male solvent workers were studied to evaluate the exposure-excretion relationship between methyl chloroform (MC)  and its metabolites [i.e., TCA, TCE and total trichloro-compounds (TTC; the sum of TCA and TCE)]. MC per se, TCA, TCE, and TTC in urine correlated significantly with MC in ambient air, and among the four the correlation coefficient was highest for MC [20].

Reduction of the exposure to 82 mg/m3 (20\n    ppm) largely eliminated the complaints. In the study of Hjelm et\n    al.

Five\n    years later, work practices had greatly improved, the highest MIBK\n    concentration was 410-430 mg/m3 (100-105 ppm), and the general\n    concentration was 205 mg/m3 (50 ppm).

When a hypothetical exposure to MIBK at 10 ppm is assumed, gives 352 or 323  micro g MIBK/l urine. Using the same equation, Kawai et al 92003) calculated at approximately 300  micro g/l [20]. Both studies indicated that the correlation of the TWA concentration of the solvent in air with the concentration of the corresponding solvent in the end-of-shift urine sample was significant.

The value chosen was also adopted by Singapore, Australia and ACGIH. OSHA formerly had no limit for methyl parathion. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.2 mg/m3, with a skin notation. NIOSH also recommends a TWA of 0.2 mg/m3 and a skin notation for methyl parathion. The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.2 mg/m 3, with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with these limits, and they are established in the final rule. Methyl parathion is a tan to brown liquid with a pungent odor like that of garlic.  Methyl parathion is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and excessive exposure can cause sweating, salivation, diarrhea, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, muscle fasciculations, and coma. By the dermal route, methyl parathion is much less toxic than parathion, with an LD(50) of 67 mg/kg in rats of both sexes (Hayes 1963/Ex. 1-982). \n\n  Plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels did not differ by more than 20 percent in subjects exposed at 7, 7.5, 8, or 9 mg/man/day, compared with controls (Moeller and Rider 1963/Ex. 1-565).  Chronic exposure to small doses of methyl parathion have not caused chromosomal effects (de Cassia Stocco, Becak, Gaeta, and Rabello-Gay 1982/Ex. 1-540).  In the final rule, OSHA establishes a limit of 0.2 mg/m3 TWA for methyl parathion, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significant risk of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which constitutes a material impairment of health that is associated with workplace exposures at levels above the new PEL.

However, most adopted common STEL value of 250 ppm. Both the ACGIH- and NIOSH-recommended limits are based on a study by Specht, Miller, Valaer, and Sayers (1940/Ex. 1-1179), which found that guinea pigs exhibited irritation and weakness on exposure to 2500 ppm, and that exposure to 5000 ppm produced narcosis and coma. The authors concluded that 2-pentanone is considerably less toxic than methyl butyl ketone but is more toxic than methyl ethyl ketone, and, in addition, is likely to be more irritating than either methyl ethyl ketone or acetone. The ACGIH-recommended limits are based on a judgment that the 200-ppm TLV-TWA and 250-ppm TLV-STEL are low enough to prevent narcosis and irritation.   OSHA has concluded that the combination of a 200-ppm TWA and a 250-ppm STEL will work together to ensure that workplace levels are maintained at levels that will prevent the occurrence of the adverse health effects associated with exposures to this chemical. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing these limits to reduce the significant risks of narcosis, a material impairment of health, which is associated with exposures to 2-pentanone at elevated short-term levels.[14]','','','ref [5] : NIOSH 1300\r\nClass : Full \r\nMethod name : KETONES I\r\nTechnique : GC-FID\r\n\r\nref [6] : NIOSH 2555\r\nClass : Partial\r\nMethod name : KETONES I\r\nTechnique : GC-FID','Reacts violently with strong oxidants, strong bases, amines and isocyanates.

It is estimated that exposing humans to methyl silicate at concentrations of 200 to 300 ppm for 15 minutes will produce lesions, and that exposure to 1000 ppm for this period will produce injury requiring hospitalization (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 409).\n\n       Rabbits exposed to 1000 ppm of methyl silicate in dry air experienced delayed eye burns (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 409).

In humans, the inhalation of naphthalene vapor causes headache, loss of appetite, and nausea (Flury and Zernik 1931g/Ex. 1-995; Patty 1949b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 420).  Ingestion of large amounts of naphthalene causes severe hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria (Stokinger and Mountain 1963/Ex. 1-765). The lethal dose in humans has been reported as 50 mg/kg (NIOSH 1977i/Ex. 1-1182). Concentrations somewhat above 15 ppm are reported to cause marked eye irritation (Robbins 1951/ Ex. 1-799).  Due to this factor, it clearly clearly shows that excursions to 15 ppm cause severe eye irritation, and OSHA thus finds the STEL both necessary and appropriate.  In the final rule, the Agency is retaining the 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm and adding a 15-minute STEL of 15 ppm for naphthalene. This STEL is designed to protect against the eye irritation observed in workers at elevated levels (Robbins 1951/Ex. 1-799). The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workers from the significant risks of eye irritation and serious ocular effects, which constitute material health impairments that are potentially associated with exposure to levels above the 8-hour limit.

ACGIH adopted a higher value since in one of the reports by  Doll, Morgan, and Speizer (1970/Ex. 1-821), who evaluated the exposures of nickel refinery workers in whom cancers had been found. Doll and associates (1970/Ex. 1-821) found that there had been no exposures to nickel carbonyl in the facility, and this finding led the ACGIH to conclude that nickel carbonyl was not the causative agent of the cancers reported among the refinery workers in the earlier studies it had relied on to set the 0.001-ppm TLV. A report that no excess nasal or lung tumors had occurred among workers exposed over a 50-year period in a nickel refinery in Wales (Renzoni, personal communication, 1975, as cited in Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values for Substances in Workroom Air, 3rd ed., ACGIH 1976) appeared to the ACGIH to corroborate Doll et al.\'s (1970/Ex. 1-821) results. The ACGIH concluded that the TLV for nickel carbonyl should be raised based on the acute, systemic effects of this substance, and that carcinogenicity was not an appropriate basis for limit-setting (ACGIH 1976). In the 1986 Documentation for the 0.05-ppm TLV for nickel carbonyl, the ACGIH (Ex. 1-3) concluded that, \"although the evidence that nickel carbonyl is carcinogenic to humans is inconclusive, this recommended TLV (i.e., one set at 0.05 ppm) is also adequate to minimize any potential carcinogenic effects\" (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 424).

It is readily absorbed through the skin ; in fatal cases of intoxication, death nearly always occurs within 1 hour and has occurred within 1 minute; the fatal adult dose is about 60 mg. Symptoms include nausea, salivation abdominal pain, vomitting, diarrehea, cold sweat, headache, dizziness, disturbed hearing and vision, confusion weakness and incoordination. Initially, respiration is deep and rapid, blood pressure is elevated and the pulse is slow; intense vagal stimulation may cause transient cardiac standstill or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the pupils are generally constricted. Excitation of the central nervous system results in tremor and sometimes clonic-tonic convulsions. As central nervous system depression ensues the pupils dilate, the blood pressure falls and the pulse becomes rapid and often irregular; faintness, prostration, dyspnea and paralysis of respiratory muscle are followed by death.

UK adopted STEL: 2 ppm. Nitrobenzene absorption, wether from inhilation of the vapor or absorption of the liquid through skin, causes anoxia due to the formation of methemoglobin; chronic exposure produces anemia.  Vapor concentrations near 40 ppm resulted in toxication of workers; exposure to vapor concentrations averaging 6 ppm caused headache and vertigo; small amounts of methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin and some Heinz bodies were found in blood. Signs and symptoms of overexposure are due to the loss of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Rapid absorption through the intact skin is frequently the main route of entry. The onset of symptoms of methemoglobinemia is often insidious and may de delayed for up to 4 hours; headache is commonly the first symptom and may become quite intense as the severity of methemoglobinemia progresses. Cyanosis develops early in the course of intoxication, first in the  lips, the nose and the ear lobes, often recognized by fellow workers. Cyanosis often occurs when the methemoglobin concentration is 15% or more.  Nitrobenzene is mildly irritating to the eyes; it may produce dermatitis due to primary irritation or sensitization.[18]','i) Total p-nitrophenol in urine: 5 mg/g creatinine                                      ii) Methemoglobin in blood: 1.5 % of hemoglobin','Human subjects retained about 80% of nitrobenzene inhaled at concentrations of 5 to 30 ?g/L [19].   Between 8 and 19 mg was absorbed by naked humans exposed to nitrobenzene for six hours at a concentration of 10 mg/m3 [20].  A major route of excretion of nitrobenzene in humans and laboratory animals is the urine. Salmowa et al. (1963) [21] exposed seven volunteers to nitrobenzene vapours (5–30 ìg/L) [5–30 mg/m3, 1–6 ppm] for 6 h. Nitrobenzene was readily absorbed, initially at an average of approximately 87% in the first hour to 73% in the sixth hour, probably because of saturation. 4-Nitrophenol rapidly appeared in the urine, and its maximal excretion, at a concentration of 5 mg/L urine, occurred approximately 2 h after the end of exposure. Of the absorbed dose, 6–37% were recovered as 4-nitrophenol [21]. At TLV of 1 ppm, ACGIH 2007 established a BEI of  5 mg/g creatinine for total 4-nitrophenol in urine. A less specific biological marker for exposure to nitrobenzene is methaemoglobin level in the blood, with a maximal permissible value of 1.5% of haemoglobin. The determinant may be present in biological specimens collected from subject who have not been occupationally exposed, at a concentration which could affect interpretation of the result. Such background concentrations are incorporated in the BEI value [9]. The recommended BEI is 5 mg/g creatinine for Total p-nitrophenol in urine and 1.5 % of hemoglobin for Methemoglobin in blood at TWA of 1 ppm.','Ref  [6]: NIOSH 2005\r\nClass: Fully Validated\r\nMethod name: Chromatography\r\nTechnique: GC-FID\r\n \r\nRef  [7]: NIOSH 2017 \r\nClass: Partially Validated\r\nMethod name: Chromatography\r\nTechnique: GC-FID','On combustion, forms toxic and corrosive fumes including nitrogen oxides.

OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m3, with a skin notation, for p-nitrochlorobenzene (PNCB). The ACGIH\'s new TLV-TWA of 0.1 ppm (0.6 mg/m3) , with a skin notation for this substance was recently reduced from a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm (3 mg/m3). The Agency proposed to retain its limit and the skin notation, and the final rule includes these limits. The primary hazards associated with exposure to PNCB include systemic toxicity to the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and kidneys, as well as methemoglobinemia and DNA damage.   p-Nitrochlorobenzene may be absorbed through the lungs and skin in humans to produce methemoglobinemia. Reports of industrial exposures indicate that overexposure causes cyanosis, weakness, and headache (Saita and Moreo 1958/Ex. 1-930; Renshaw and Ashcroft 1926/Ex. 1-522). In a study of workmen exposed to average concentrations of PNCB at 55, 125, or 143 ppm and to a 23-ppm concentration of a PNCB-nitrophenol mixture, the authors concluded that the mixed exposure did not produce chronic intoxication, but did cause increased methemoglobin, the appearance of Heinz bodies, headache, vertigo, and occasional eczema; these effects could not be attributed definitely either to skin absorption or to the level of PNCB in the mixture (Pacseri, Magos, and Batskor 1958/Ex. 1-521).   NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B and Tr. III, pp. 97-98) notes that this substance is a potential occupational carcinogen and that the risk remaining at the PEL is substantial; NIOSH therefore regards p-nitrochlorobenzene as a candidate for a full Section 6(b) rulemaking. The set limits are necessary to protect workers from the significant risks of methemoglobinemia and changes in the spleen, liver, and kidney possible at higher exposure levels. The skin notation is included because dermal absorption of PNCB has been shown to cause systemic effects in humans and animals. Methemoglobinemia and spleen, kidney, and liver damage constitute material impairments of health.

NIOSH concurs with the OSHA standard. ACGIH has designated 4-nitrobiphenyl as an A1 substance (confirmed human carcinogen). The ACGIH recommends that virtually no exposure to the compound be permitted.  OSHA  does not have a specific permissible exposure limit (PEL) for 4-nitrobiphenyl. Because of the known metabolic conversion of 4-nitrobiphenyl to 4-aminodiphenyl in animals and the potential conversion in humans, it is not possible to separate the exposure to either substance. Therefore, the carcinogenicity of 4-nitrobiphenyl alone has not been documented in human epidemiologic studies.

Both the ACGIH and NIOSH have recommended occupational limits for nitrogen dioxide. The current ACGIH recommendation is for a 3 ppm TWA and a 5 ppm STEL. The NIOSH REL is 1 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. OSHA\'s former PEL was 5 ppm as a ceiling value. The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes, a permissible exposure limit for nitrogen dioxide of 1 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agreed with the selection of this PEL.   The previous ACGIH TLV of 5 ppm as a ceiling concentration (the basis for the former OSHA limit) was based primarily on the animal studies of Gray, MacNamee, and Goldberg (1952/ Ex. 1-154), Gray, Goldberg, and Patton (1954/Ex. 1-165), and Wagner, Duncan, Wright, and Stokinger (1965/Ex. 1-102). Gray, MacNamee, and Goldberg (1952/Ex. 1-154), and Gray, Goldberg and Patton (1954/Ex. 1-165).  The ACGIH\'s recommendation that the 5-ppm TLV be defined as a ceiling rather than as an 8-hour TWA was based on reports that NO2 accelerated lung tumor development among lung-tumor-susceptible mice; in the late 1960s, the ACGIH believed that a TLV-ceiling value would minimize the risk of accelerating lung tumor development.   The current ACGIH TLVs for NO2 are a 3-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 5-ppm STEL, and they are based on human studies that indicate that normal respiratory function may be compromised at exposures below the current OSHA ceiling limit of 5 ppm NO2. In particular, Kosmider, Ludyga, Misiewicz et al. (1972/ Ex. 1-224) reported a slight reduction in vital capacity and maximum respiratory volume in 70 men exposed to 0.4- to 2.7-ppm concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen six to eight hours daily for four to six years.

In the final rule, OSHA is establishing 15-minute STELs of 0.1 mg/m3 for NG and retaining the skin notations for this substance.  This compound is commonly used together with ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN). Most occupational exposures to EGDN actually involve mixtures of EGDN and NG. Because EGDN is 160 times more volatile than nitroglycerin and most of the mixtures of these two substances used in industry consist of 60 to 80 percent EGDN, the adverse effects associated with the inhalation of the vapors from such mixtures can be attributed primarily to EGDN.

TWA:50 ppm were chosen as adopted by ACGIH and our neighbour, Singapore. OSHA does not currently regulate nitrous oxide. NIOSH has established a recommended TWA: 25 ppm (45 mg/m3) [NIOSH 1992].  ACGIH has assigned TWA: 50 ppm (90 mg/m3) as [ACGIH 1994, p. 28]. The NIOSH limit is based on the risk of reproductive system effects and decreases in audiovisual performance [NIOSH 1992]. The ACGIH limit is based on the risk of reproductive, hematological, and nervous system effects [ACGIH 1991, p. 1137]. Exposure to nitrous oxide occurs through inhalation. Nitrous oxide has central nervous system, teratogenic, bone marrow, and liver effects in animals [ACGIH 1991]. Exposure to nitrous oxide also causes neurotoxic (spinal cord lesions, demyelination, peripheral neuropathy) and hepatotoxic (focal inflammatory lesions) effects in experimental animals [ACGIH 1991]. Nitrous oxide is an asphyxiant at high concentrations. At lower concentrations, exposure causes central nervous system, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematopoietic, and reproductive effects in humans [Hathaway et al. 1991]. At a concentration of 50 to 67 percent (500,000 to 670,000 ppm) nitrous oxide is used to induce anesthesia in humans [Rom 1992]. Patients exposed to a 50:50 mixture of nitrous oxide:oxygen for prolonged periods to induce continuous sedation developed bone marrow depression and granulocytopenia [Hathaway et al. 1991; ACGIH 1991]. Although most patients recover, several deaths from aplastic anemia have been reported [Hathaway et al. 1991]. Neurotoxic effects occur after acute exposure to concentrations of 80,000 to 200,000 ppm and above; effects include slowed reaction times and performance decrements [Hathaway et al. 1991]. Long-term occupational exposure (dentists, dental assistants) has been associated with numbness, difficulty in concentrating, paresthesias, and impairment of equilibrium [Hathaway et al. 1991; ACGIH 1991]. Epidemiological studies, primarily of operating room personnel, have shown increased risks of spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and involuntary infertility among these occupationally exposed populations [ACGIH 1991; Hathaway et al. 1991].','','','Ref [3] NIOSH 3800\r\nClass: Fully validated\r\nMethod name: Organic and inorganic gases by extractive FTIR spectrometry\r\nTechnique: Extractive fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry.\r\n\r\nRef [4] NIOSH 6600\r\nClass: Fully validated\r\nMethod name: NITROUS OXIDE\r\nTechnique: Long-pathlength portable infrared spectrophotometer (field readout)\r\n\r\nRef [5] OSHA ID-166\r\nClass: Fully validated\r\nMethod name: Nitrous oxide in workplace atmospheres (passive monitor)\r\nTechnique: Infra-red (IR) spectroscopy','Reacts violently with sulphurous anhydride, amorphous boron, phosphine, ethers, aluminium, hydrazine, phenyl-lithium and tungsten carbide causing fire and explosion hazard.

The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA PEL for nonane of 200 ppm.  The toxicity of nonane is approximately equal to that of VM&P naphtha. Naphtha has a 4-hour inhalation LC(50) for rats of 3400 ppm, while nonane has an LC(50) of 3200 ppm (Carpenter, Kinkead, Geary et al. 1975a/Ex. 1-302; Carpenter, Geary, Myers et al. 1978/Ex. 1-301). These investigators found a no-effect level of 590 ppm nonane for rats exposed six hours/day, five days/week for a 65-day period; under the same exposure conditions, a no-effect level of 560 ppm was reported for rats exposed to VM&P naphtha (Carpenter, Kinkead, Geary et al. 1975a/Ex. 1-302; Carpenter, Geary, Myers et al. 1978/Ex. 1-301).

The Agency proposed to obtain the 8-hour TWA and to add a STEL of 0.3 mg/m3, also with a skin notation, for this substance, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) and ACGIH concurred. These limits are established in the final rule.  Inhalation toxicity data for octachloronaphthalene fumes or dust are lacking, but exposure to the chloronaphthalenes causes acne-like lesions that itch severely. Repeated exposures to the fumes of molten chlorinated naphthalenes can cause severe and sometimes fatal systemic poisoning and are especially damaging to the liver (Patty 1963g/Ex. 1-845). Ingestion studies of cattle have shown different toxicities for different naphthalenes, with toxicity increasing with the compound\'s degree of chlorination (Sikes, Wise, and Bridges 1952/Ex. 1-804). However, these data are controverted by another report in which octachloronaphthalene was found to be less toxic than the hexachloro derivative (Bell 1953/Ex. 1-951). This divergence in the data may be due to differing methods of administration (suspension versus solution), or may reflect the soluble form\'s greater capacity for absorption (ACGIH 1986/ Ex. 1-3, p. 447). These would be the adopted values as adopted by many countries  like UK and Singapore i.e.  retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m3 and adding a STEL of 0.3 mg/m3, with a skin notation, for octachloronaphthalene. The combined limit will protect workers against the significant risks of serious liver damage and dermal lesions, which constitute material health impairments and are associated with exposure to this substance at the elevated levels permitted by an 8-hour limit alone. The skin notation is retained because of octachloronaphthalene\'s demonstrated ability to cause systemic toxicity by percutaneous absorption.

The proposed PELs were an 8-hour TWA of 300 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 375 ppm, and these are the limits promulgated in the final rule.   Mice exposed to octane concentrations of 6600 to 13,700 ppm developed narcosis within 30 to 90 minutes (Fuhner 1921, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 448). Flury and Zernik (1931h, as cited in ACGIH l986/Ex.l-3, p. 448) believed the narcotic concentration in humans to be 5000 ppm; Patty and Yant (1929, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 448) placed the narcotic concentration at 8000 ppm. Based on this information, the ACGIH concluded that octane was 1.2 to 2 times more toxic than heptane, and recommended TLVs of 300 ppm TWA and 375 ppm STEL. This is the basis for adopting this value for Malaysia. UK and Australia have these values. OSHA notes that octane is considered more toxic than heptane, for which OSHA is establishing limits of 400 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 500 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. Short-term effects have been observed in humans and animals exposed to the hexane isomers at levels below 500 ppm (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66), and OSHA finds it appropriate to establish a STEL for octane and several other alkanes to protect against these narcotic effects. These limits will protect workers from the significant risks of narcosis, a material health impairment that is associated with octane exposures.

The Agency proposed to retain 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA PEL and to add 10 mg/m3 as a 15-minute STEL; however, the final rule retains the former 8-hour TWA but does not add a STEL. The ACGIH has a 5-mg/m3 TLV-TWA limit and a 10-mg/m3 TLV-STEL for oil mist (mineral), which refers to the airborne mist of petroleum-based cutting oils or of white petroleum oil; the odor of this substance is described as similar to that of burned lubrication oil.   Studies in animals have shown that repeated six-hour daily exposures to 5 mg/m3 caused no adverse effects (Wagner, Wright, and Stokinger 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 449). At 100 mg/m3,slight changes, including lung effects, were observed in exposed animals (Lushbaugh, Green, and Redemann 1950/Ex. 1-792). It has been suggested that heat-decomposed oil fumes are irritating to the lungs (Wagner, Dobrogorski, and Stokinger 1961/Ex. 1-773). “No health effect has been observed in humans\" (Ex. 3-856). This view was shared by representatives of the Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association (Ex. 3-830), the Specialty Steel Industry of the United States (Ex.3-829), and the Anti-Friction Bearing Manufacturers Association(Ex. 3-1115). . According to the UAW, oil mist \"has been known for many years...[to] cause skin cancer, particularly scrotal cancer among exposed workers\" (Tr. p. 7-50). The UAW also believes that oil mist exposure increases the risk of primary malignancies of the respiratory and upper digestive systems (Tr. p.7-50). However, OSHA believes that these carcinogenic effects maybe attributable to contaminants in the oil, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and certain additives. that the existing 8-hour TWA limit will protect exposed employees against the significant risks of eye and respiratory tract irritation potentially associated with exposures to mineral oil mist. OSHA finds that these eye and lung effects constitute material impairments of health.

Based on the ACGIH recommendation, OSHA proposed to revise this limit to 0.002 mg/m3 as a TWA and to add a STEL of 0.006 mg/m3; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. Malaysia concurs with his justification. So do many countries that adopted these values. The final rule establishes these limits for this substance. Industrial experience indicates that concentrations in a precious metal refining plant ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 mg/m3; intermittent exposures produced symptoms (sometimes delayed) of lacrimation, vision disturbances, headache, conjunctivitis, and cough (McLaughlin, Milton, and Perry 1946/Ex. 1-749). Complaints of persistent and severe nose and throat irritation have been reported (Hamilton and Hardy 1974a/Ex. 1-957). Fairhall (1949d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 450) reported a human fatality resulting from inhalation exposure to OsO4. Flury and Zernik (1931i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 450) reported that 0.001 mg/m3 is the highest concentration of osmium tetroxide that can be tolerated for six hours without harmful effects. The McLaughlin et al. (1946/ Ex. 1-749) study demonstrates serious, acute effects resulting from intermittent and short-term exposure. OSHA concludes that, in the absence of a limit on short-term exposures, the 0.002-mg/m3 8-hour TWA PEL alone is not sufficient to protect employees from experiencing these effects, which are deemed to constitute material impairments of health. Therefore, to reduce the risk from short-term elevated exposures to osmium tetroxide, OSHA is establishing a 15-minute STEL of 0.006 mg/m3 to supplement the 0.002-mg/m3 TWA limit.

The final rule retains the 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3 for oxalic acid and adds a STEL of 2 mg/m3. Similar justifications were used for Malaysia. Oxalic acid is known to produce severe burns of the eyes, mucous membranes, and skin (Windholz 1983d/Ex. 1-835, p. 991). There have been human fatalities from ingesting as little as 5 grams of oxalic acid. It appears that these deaths were caused by oxalic acid\'s ability to disturb the calcium-potassium balance in critical tissues (Klauder, Shelanski, and Gabriel 1955/Ex. 1-1057). Solutions of 5- to 10-percent oxalic acid have also been reported to irritate the skin on prolonged exposure. Because of oxalic acid\'s severe acute toxicity, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m3 PEL and adding a STEL of 2 mg/m3 in the final rule. The Agency concludes that both of these limits are required to protect exposed workers from the significant risk of severe eye and skin burns and respiratory tract irritation, which are material health impairments associated with elevated short-term exposures at levels above the TWA limit.

The former PEL for oxygen difluoride was 0.05 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIH has established a limit of 0.05 ppm as a ceiling value. The revision of the TLV for oxygen difluoride from an 8-hour TWA to a ceiling value reflects the general position of the ACGIH that ceiling TLVs are more appropriate for chemicals that cause acute but not chronic health effects. OSHA proposed a permissible exposure limit of 0.05 ppm ceiling for oxygen difluoride. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the selection of this limit, and it is established in the final rule.  Oxygen difluoride is a substance having extremely high acute toxicity; it is an acute irritant and causes fatal pulmonary edema and hemorrhage in animals exposed to 0.5 ppm for a few hours (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). A single exposure to 0.1 ppm also had an effect on the lungs, as evidenced by development in animals of a tolerance to the acute effects of this substance after an isolated exposure. Animals acutely exposed to oxygen difluoride have also exhibited gross changes in the kidneys and internal genitalia (LaBelle, Metcalf, Suter, and Smith 1945, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 452; Lester and Adams 1965/Ex. 1-963).   Because of the extreme acute toxicity of this compound and the effects noted at 0.1 ppm, the former TWA-PEL of 0.05 ppm was not sufficiently protective of workers; this former limit would still permit the brief periods of high exposure that have been associated with severe lung damage, which the Agency has determined represents a material impairment of health. Therefore, to reduce the significant risk of acute lung damage associated with brief excursion exposures to oxygen difluoride, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit of 0.05 ppm for this substance.

Several countries like New Zealand and Singapore adopted similar approaches and UK adopted STEL:0.2 ppm.  Malaysia adopted the sets of values outlined by ACGIH and also STEL: 0.2 ppm as adopted by UK. This fits in to the nature of  industries in Malaysia. Ozone is highly injurious and lethal in experimental animals at concentrations as low as a few parts per million (Stokinger 1957/Ex. 1-97). A study in which young mice were exposed to 1 ppm ozone for one or two days reported damage to alveolar tissue (Bils 1970/Ex. 1-58). Human populations chronically exposed to lower concentrations of ozone have been observed to have changes in lung function. In one study, human volunteers exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone for three hours per day, six days per week, for 12 weeks showed significant changes in lung function (Jaffe 1967/Ex. 1-101). Welders exposed to maximal ozone concentrations of 9 ppm were observed to have pulmonary congestion (Kleinfeld and Giel 1956/Ex. 1-120).

ACGIH recommended an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 mg/m3 and  NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. Paraffin is a white or slightly yellow, odorless solid that is derived from petroleum.  Paraffin is considered nontoxic in its solid state, but fume generated when it is in the molten state may cause discomfort and nausea (Queries and Minor Notes, JAMA 1938/ Ex. 1-308). In the most recent report of industrial exposure effects, paraffin fume is reported to cause no discomfort in most cases when the concentration is maintained at or below 2 mg/m3, although one instance of mild discomfort was reported at concentrations between 0.6 and 1 mg/m3 (Massachusetts Division of Occupational Hygiene 1970, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 455). It is a main concern about workplaces in which paraffin is used in large quantities, such as the food industry, and a greater degree of exposure control is needed. To protect employees in these industries from experiencing acute adverse effects, such as discomfort and nausea, it is justifiable that a PEL for paraffin wax fume is necessary. The Agency has determined that the adverse effects associated with excessive exposure to paraffin wax fume constitute material impairments of health. The limit of 2 mg/m3 has been shown to be effective in reducing this risk (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 455); therefore, OSHA is establishing this limit for paraffin wax fume.

The ACGIH has established a limit of 0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes, a permissible exposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 TWA for this substance; the skin notation is retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. Malaysia adopted these 2 values although countries like Australia ad New Zealand just adopted one value of TWA:0.1 mg/m3. Paraquat refers to a group of compounds that are odorless, yellow solids. The principal compounds are: 1,1\'-dimethyl-4,4\'-bipyridinium; 1,1\'-dimethyl-4,4\'-bipyridinium bis (methyl sulfate); and 1,1\'-dimethyl-4,4\'-bipyridinium dichloride.  The toxicity of these compounds depends on the compound\'s cationic moiety. Acute oral toxicity is reported as 30 mg/kg ion as cation for guinea pigs and 127 mg/kg ion for female rats, while the dermal LD(50) in rabbits is 240 mg/kg ion (Clark 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456; Clark, McElligott, and Hurst 1966/Ex. 1-503; McElligott 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456). Paraquat can penetrate broken skin after it has broken down the skin\'s usual barriers (Swan 1969/Ex. 1-576; Clark, McElligott, and Hurst 1966/Ex. 1-503). By inhalation or intratracheal injection, paraquat is very toxic because of its irritant properties (Gage 1968/ Ex. 1-508). When the diameter of the particles in the aerosol are not of respirable size, toxicity is greatly reduced. In humans, 69 accidental deaths and 81 suicides were attributed to the effects of paraquat exposure up to 1972 (Chipman Chemicals 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456). Bouletreau, Ducluzeau, Bui-Xuan et al. (1977/ Ex. 1-538) reported 31 cases of renal insufficiency, and a spray applicator was killed when he absorbed a lethal dose of inadequately diluted paraquat through the skin (Jaros 1978/Ex. 1-513). Workers using a 0.05- to 1-percent solution of paraquat developed skin and mucous membrane irritation but experienced no symptoms of systemic poisoning (Howard 1978/Ex. 1-512).

The central nervous system, blood, respiratory system, eyes, and skin are the organs most affected by acute exposure of humans to parathion.  Chronic (long-term) inhalation and oral exposure of humans and animals to parathion have been observed to result in depressed red blood cell cholinesterase activity, nausea, and headache.  No information is available on reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of parathion in humans.

On a similar note, Malaysia is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.005 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 0.015 ppm for pentaborane. These  limits will protect workers against the significant risk of central nervous system effects, such as tremors and convulsions, behavioral changes, and loss of judgment, potentially associated with exposure to pentaborane at levels only slightly above those formerly permitted by the 8-hour TWA alone.

After inhalation, respiratory and ocular effects (wheezing, laryngeal spasms, blurred vision, miosis, and tearing) are first to occur. Gastrointestinal effects occur after ingestion; these include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps. Skin absorption leads to localized sweating and muscular twitching. Severe TEPP poisoning by any route may lead to paralysis of the respiratory muscles and death. Repeated exposure to small doses of TEPP may have cumulative effects and lead to the same signs and symptoms as those seen in acute poisoning.

Repeated inhalation exposure (7 hours/day, 5days/week) to 83 mg/m3 air for 6 months did not lead to any chemical-related changes in the rat, guinea pig and rabbit. The daily intake is equivalent to roughly 11 mg/kg/day in rat, 7.4mg/kg/day in guinea pig, and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbit. In humans, this chemical was reported to act as a narcotic in low concentration, and irritate the conjunctiva, the mucosa of the respiratory tract and the external skin. Moreover, gastrointestinal tract complaints, fatty degeneration of the kidneys and lung damage by prolonged exposure were reported. Most countries adopt a 1ppm TWA which is about 7 mg.m-3 , a much lower value compared to the long term inhalation test to rats and rabbits.

The apparent elimination half-lives are 50 to 100 hours for trichloroacetic acid (TCAA)  and  about 12 to 26 hours for trichloroethanol (TCOH). The relationship between the degree of exposure and TCOH excretion, total trichloro-compounds(TTC), the sum of TCAA, and free and conjugated TCOH expressed as TCAA remain linear below 1600 mg/m [18].  Some investigators suggest that the correlation between the TRI concentration environmental air and TCAA excretion in urine is linear only if the exposure concentration is below 269 mg/m3  [19]. Imbriani et al (2001) found  a strong linear relationship between TRI in urine and environmental TRI exposure (r=0.84,) [20].

Rabbits exposed by inhalation to a 1.27-mg/m3 concentration of thiram for 30 days or to 1.9 mg/m3 for 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks showed kidney and liver degeneration and lung irritation at autops. Rats fed thiram at doses ranging from 3 to 67 mg/kg or at 100 to 1000 ppm for longer periods (1 to 1.5 years) showed nervous system changes (weakness, ataxia, hind leg paralysis, leg muscular dystrophy), increased relative liver and kidney weights, and histologic changes of the thyroid (squamous metaplasia), testes, ovaries, liver, kidneys, brain, spleen, and pancreas. In humans, thiram is an eye, nose, and throat irritant, a central nervous system toxin, and a skin sensitizer. Volunteers given daily thiram doses of 0.5 g/day for several weeks showed no adverse effects. One worker who treated seeds with thiram for a 10-hour period, during which he was estimated to have received a \"substantial\" exposure, died 4 days later. Several members of a group of workers exposed to thiram during the planting of trees reported experiencing eye, nose, and throat irritation, headache, and skin problems. Based on these studies and observations, OSHA and NIOSH adopted a TWA of 5 mg/m3. ACGIH on the other hand adopted 1 mg/m3. Considering the fact that thiram is a widely used pesticide and is presumably important in the agricultural sector, we decide to adopt an occupational exposure standard of 5 mg.m-3 (TWA).

It cannot be claimed that long term effects on central nervous system as no evidence of this can be observed after repeated exposure to 50 and 200ppm of toluene. Based on the studies, a 50 ppm TWA is selected using the basis of critical health effect upon the central nervous system.

When trichloroacetic acid was instilled into the eye of rabbits, severe irritation was observed characterized by severe and extensive loss of epithelium and endothelium, infiltration and hemorrhage about the limbal vessels, infiltration and hyperemia of the iris, and damage to the anterior layers of the lens. Trichloroacetic acid is a mild skin irritant in rabbits. Animals poisoned by oral doses (400 mg/kg ) of trichloroacetic acid quickly passed into a state of narcosis or semi-narcosis, and within 36 hours they either recovered completely or died. Male rats administered 50, 500, or 5,000 ppm trichloroacetic acid in their drinking water for 90 days developed a significant increase in relative kidney weight, and a significant increase in hepatic peroximal beta oxidation activity and focal areas of hepatocellular hypertrophy. In a chronic study, mice were administered trichloroacetic acid in the drinking water at concentrations of 2,000 or 5,000 ppm for 61 weeks. Both dose levels of trichloroacetic acid induced hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas. Trichloroacetic acid is irritating and corrosive to the skin, eye, and mucous membranes in humans, but is not readily absorbed through the skin. Trichloroacetic acid can denature protein and precipitate protein and may cause chemical burns to tissue. The extent of the damage caused is dependant upon the concentration of the material and the duration of the exposure. ACGIH  has assigned trichloroacetic acid a threshold limit value of 1 ppm as a TWA for a normal 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek. The limit is based on the risk of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation. Most countries and institutions concur to this value. This value is suggested as the Malaysian PEL.

Anesthetized dogs, rats, mice, monkeys, hamsters, and rabbits exposed to concentrations ranging from 54,000 to 150,000 ppm exhibited various cardiovascular and circulatory abnormalities. At high doses, the animals experienced labored breathing, twitching, unresponsiveness, and unconsciousness. Cardiac arrhythmias were induced in dogs at 3,500 to 6,100 ppm for a duration of 5 minutes. In monkeys, the minimum dose producing cardiac arrest was 50,000 ppm. In a subchronic study, rats and rabbits exposed to 50,000 ppm for one hour twice daily for 15 days showed increased blood glucose and lactic acid, decreased oxygen uptake, and other biochemical changes consistent with slowing of cellular oxidation. In animals with pre-existing lung or heart conditions, fluorotrichloromethane is significantly toxic and may cause toxicity at lower doses. In hamsters with hereditary heart defects, a concentration of only 2 percent was lethal. In rats with emphysema, respiratory problems can be observed at a concentration of 2.5 percent. Nine application of 0.1 ml drops during an eleven-day period in the eye of rabbits produced nothing more than hyperemia (lasting several hours), and mild inflammation of the eyelids. By analogy with effects seen in animals, fluorotrichloromethane (freon-11) is expected to cause cardia arrhythmias and cardia sensitization in humans. The concentrations of Freon-11 that are required to produce cardiac sensitization are well above those normally encountered in industrial use. Exposure to 1,000 ppm fluorotrichloromethane for 8 hours/day, 5 days/week for 18 exposures produced no ill effects on humans.

It may also cause skin sensitization and central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract effects. The lowest estimated oral dose reported to be lethal in humans is 441 mg/kg. Exposure to a 75-ppm concentration for 3 to 5 minutes irritates the nose and throat, and exposure to a 175-ppm concentration irritates the eyes and may be considered intolerable by human volunteers. Ingestion of turpentine causes a burning pain in the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, excitement, ataxia, confusion, stupor, seizures, fever, and tachycardia and may cause death due to respiratory failure. Toxic glomerulonephritis and bladder irritation, with hematuria, albuminuria, oliguria, and dysuria, have been associated with overexposure to the vapor of turpentine in the past; however, the more purified form of turpentine now in use appears to have decreased the incidence of or to have eliminated turpentine-induced nephritis. Splashes of the liquid in the eye produce severe pain and blepharospasm; conjunctival redness and temporary corneal erosion may also occur, but these effects are reversible. Chronic skin exposure to turpentine may produce a hypersensitivity reaction, with bullous dermatitis and/or eczema. UK set an occupational exposure standard at 100 pm (TWA) and a short-term exposure (STEL) at 150 ppm.

Vinyl bromide was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Based on this evidence, IARC has concluded that the evidence for the carcinogenicity of vinyl bromide in animals is sufficient . The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concludes that there is no adequate data on the carcinogenicity of vinyl bromide in humans and classifies vinyl bromide as a Group 2A (probable human) carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. ACGIH sets the occupational exposure standard  at a low 0.5 ppm and it is believed  that at this level it is unlikely to produce adverse effects. We concur to this value.

In a chronic study, rats were administered vinyl cyclohexene dioxide dissolved in acetone at doses of 0, 15 or 30 mg/animal, 5 days/week for 105 weeks and mice were administered 0, 2.5, 5, or 50 mg/animal 5 days/week for 103 weeks. The vinyl cyclohexene dioxide treatment was acutely necrotizing causing local ulcerations. In addition, mice and rats developed acanthosis and hyperkeratosis at the site of treatment and the mice also developed sebaceous gland hyperplasia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity in rats based on an increased incidence of squamous cell and basal cell papillomas of the skin. In two other studies, vinyl cyclohexene dioxide also caused skin tumors after chronic dermal treatment. Industrial experience suggests that vinyl cyclohexene dioxide is a mild to moderate skin irritant. Severe irritation has been reported when shoes contaminated by vinyl cyclohexene dioxide were put on. IARC has examined the evidence for the carcinogenicity of vinyl cyclohexene dioxide in humans and determined that there is no data upon which to base a classification of the carcinogenicity of vinyl cyclohexene dioxide to humans. Relying on this basis, an occupational exposure standard was set at 0.1 ppm. It is thought that this would provide a protection for workers exposed to VCD from skin irritation and potential carcinogenic effects. It has been noted in a comment by Matthew Gillen and Scott Schneider of the Workers Institute for Safety and Health (WISH) commented that a 1 ppm PEL is probably sufficient but this claim was not substantiated clearly.

In a teratogenicity study, rats and rabbits were exposed by inhalation to 10, 80 or 160 ppm vinylidene chloride for 7 hours/day on gestation days 6 to 15 (rats) or 6 to 18 (rabbits). Increased resorptions were observed in rabbits exposed to 160 ppm, while increased incidences of skeletal malformations were observed in rats exposed to 80 and 160 ppm and rabbits exposed to 160 ppm. Vinylidene chloride was tested for carcinogenicity in mice and rats by oral administration and inhalation exposure, in mice by topical exposure, and in hamsters by inhalation. Studies in mice and rats by oral administration gave negative results. The inhalation studies resulted in no treatment-related neoplasms in either the rats or hamsters; in mice, the treatment related increases in the incidence of kidney adenocarcinomas were observed as were increases in mammary carcinomas in females and pulmonary adenomas in both male and female mice. In skin-painting studies conducted on female mice, vinylidene chloride showed activity as an initiator, but in a study of repeated skin application, no skin tumors occurred.  IARC concluded that there is limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of vinylidene chloride to experimental animals. Vinylidene chloride is an eye irritant and can affect the central nervous system, liver, and kidneys in humans. Contact with the eyes can cause conjunctivitis and transient corneal injury. Workers exposed to high concentrations (4,000 ppm) of vinylidene chloride may show signs of central nervous system depression with accompanying signs of intoxication that may progress to unconsciousness. Repeated exposures to low concentrations are associated with liver and kidney dysfunction.

Rats tolerated exposure to 300 ppm for 60 hours without symptoms; however, vinyl toluene was found at autopsy to have accumulated in the peritoneal fat of these animals, and neurochemical effects were detected by enzyme assay. Rats exposed 92 or 100 times to between 1130 and 1250 ppm for 7 to 8 hours/day showed an increase in kidney and liver weights and fatty degeneration of the liver at autopsy. No adverse effects were seen in animals of any species when the vinyl toluene concentration was reduced to 600 ppm. Teratogenic effects were observed among the offspring of guinea pigs exposed by inhalation to 6 ppm vinyl toluene for 4 months. Intraperitoneal doses of 3750 mg/kg administered to rats on days 1 through 15 of pregnancy induced post-implantation mortality and fetotoxic effects. Vinyl toluene irritates the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes in humans. Vinyl toluene concentrations of 400 ppm cause eye, nose, and mucous membrane irritation; at 300 ppm, this substance has a strong, objectionable odor, and at 200 ppm, the odor is tolerable. Contact of the skin with vinyl toluene may cause irritation and redness. Vinyl toluene is believed to have anesthetic and systemic effects at high concentrations. Vinyl toluene induces sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro. To ensure sfae margin from irritation of mucous membrane and skin, ACGIH sets an occupational exposure standard was at 50 ppm TWA and a short-term exposure at 100 ppm.

Middle distillates containing no detectable polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were inactive as mutagens in the Ames assay. The genotoxic potential of these compounds is linked to their polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon content. Topical application of petroleum middle distillates to mice was associated with severe skin irritation and a significant increase in squamous cell carcinomas.

Two deaths occurred among 14 members of a Korean family ingesting an estimated 1-2 mg/kg dose of warfarin per day for 15 days in contaminated cornmeal.

Rats exposed by inhalation or intratracheal instillation of welding fumes from mild-steel welding showed non- specific pulmonary changes with no signs of fibrosis over a period of 450 days. The primary effects observed included particle- laden macrophage aggregates, and alveolar epithelial thickening with proliferation of granular pneumocytes. Similar changes were observed in the lungs of rats exposed to 1,000 mg/m(3) for 1 hour or to 400 mg/m(3) for 30 minutes/day, six days/week over a two-week period. Welding fumes were not associated with an increased incidence of genotoxicity in 11 of 15 in vitro assays, and in all three in vivo tests performed for genotoxicity. Exposure to welding fumes from mild steel is associated with the development of a benign pneumoconiosis, \"arc welder\'s siderosis\". Exposure to welding fumes can result in metal fume fever. There is an excess of infertility among welders that led to studies on sperm quality and welding exposures. There appears to be an increased frequency of abnormalities in semen quality associated with duration of exposure. IARC concluded that there is limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of welding fumes and gases. This conclusion was based primarily on a review of 11 cohort studies and 12 case-control studies on lung cancer; only three of these studies (all cohort studies) specifically examined manual metal arc welding of iron, mild steel, or aluminum. Two of the cohort studies found no association between welding fumes and cancer. The remaining cohort studies showed an increased risk for lung cancer, which in some may have been inflated due to selection bias. Ten out of twelve case- control studies showed an association between lung cancer and exposure or employment as a welder. Two of the studies found no risk. IARC\'s final conclusion was that welding fumes are possibly carcinogenic to humans. Based on the possibility of carcinogenic effects on humans and the extensive use of welding, we suggest that exposure limit (PEL) for welding fumes (and total particulates) to be of the lowest feasible concentration achievable by the respective industries.

Mucostasis was observed in furniture workers when exposure to average dust levels were above 2.2 mg.m-3 (range 1 to 3 mg.m-3). The cells lining in the nasal cavity undergo varying degrees of change (dysplasia) following hardwood dust inhalation. The most severe changes are generally associated with the highest exposures. It has been suggested that extreme dysplasia should be suspected as representing pre-cancerous changes. It has been reported that only 40% of those diagnosed survive more than 5 years and ultimately, almost all die of the tumour. [12]\n\nExposure to wood dusts can also result in eye and skin irritation, dermatitis, respiratory system effects (including hypersensitivity, asthma, suberosis, granulomatous pneumonitis, or acute airway obstruction), and cancer in humans. Exposure to wood dust can result in the development of contact dermatitis. The primary irritant dermatitis resulting from skin contact with wood dusts consist of erythema, blistering, and sometimes erosion and secondary infections occur. The irritant chemicals are normally found in the outer part of the wood in the sap or bark, and therefore, loggers and other workers involved in the initial handling of the wood experience dermatitis. The allergic dermatitis typically results in redness, scaling, and itching, which may become vesicular dermatitis if exposures are repeated. This type of dermatitis often occurs on the hands, face, forearms, eyelids, neck, and genitals, and will sometimes not appear until several years have passed following the exposure, although frequently the signs are apparent within a few days or weeks. The chemicals causing this effect are generally found in the heartwood, and therefore those workers involved in secondary wood processing are affected (e.g. carpenters, furniture makers, etc.). Certain wood dust (primarily african woods, and cork) are also associated with asthma. Acute and chronic respiratory system reactions to exposure can include chronic bronchitis, or chronic airflow limitation associated with asthma. An increased risk of nasal tumors (primarily adenocarcinomas) is associated with exposure to wood dust.  IARC has concluded that there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of furniture and cabinet making to humans, there is limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of carpentry and joinery, and there is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of lumber and sawmill industries and pulp and paper manufacturing. Hard wood dust appears to be the primary substance of concern, although the carcinogenic substances in hardwood are unknown. A TWA is set at 10 mg.m-3 (8-hour TWA) total inhalable dust and this should minimize short-term effects such as irritation.

Exposure at 300ppm affected the sense of balance, caused visual disturbances and slowed reaction-times and some effects were seen at 200ppm; but exposure to 160ppm over 4 hours caused no significant adverse health effects. At around 700 ppm for up to 1 hour, headache, dizziness and nausea occur. The irritant effects reported at 100ppm appear to be minimal and this was considered to be a no-effect level. In view of the \'irritant\' effects an occupational exposure standard of 100ppm (8-hour TWA) is appropriate. Since irritant effects can arise with even brief exposures at higher levels a STEL of 150ppm (10-minute reference period) is set. The limits apply to o-, m-, p-, isomers of xylene, or mixture thereof. The isometric composition of xylene is not considered an important factor in its health effects.

Based on the regression model, the calculated value was 1.27 and 1.28 g/g creatinine at 100 ppm exposure which was slightly lower than the recommended ACGIH 2007 BEI value.

In a separate study, a 10-percent mixture of MXDA caused severe skin irritation and erythema in guinea pigs. It is also reported that rats exposed to levels of MXDA ranging from 1.74 to 6.04 mg/liter even for one hour sustained liver, kidney, and lung damage, as determined at necropsy. One study showed mild sensitization when MXDA was applied to guinea pig skin, but this effect was not observed in a second study.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded that there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of zinc chromate in experimental animals. Exposure to zinc chromate can cause irritation, tissue ulceration, and cancer in humans. Inhalation of dusts containing chromates causes irritation of the mucous membranes . Gastric distress, olfactory sense impairment, and the yellowing of teeth and tongue may also result from excessive exposures to chromates. If exposures are prolonged, ulcerations of the nasal mucosae may occur as well as possible septal perforations. Prolonged dermal contact may produce ulceration of the skin. The increased exposure that results from an ulcer may result in renal chromate toxicosis, liver failure or death. Ocular effects including eye lesions, conjunctivitis, and keratitis have been associated with exposures to chromates. Prolonged exposure to chromates can cause chronic bronchitis, rhinitis, or the growth of nasal mucosal polyps. Exposures may also lead to chemical pneumonitis. Chronic exposures to hexavalent chromium compounds can cause lung and gastrointestinal tract cancer including cancer of the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and pancreas. Of six studies that examined the association between exposure to zinc chromate and lung cancer, five were cohort studies and one was a proportionate mortality study. In four of the five cohort studies there were also exposures to lead chromates. All of the cohort studies demonstrated an association between exposure to chromates and lung cancer. It was noted that because of the compounded exposures with lead chromate it was not possible to separate out the effects caused by each individual chromate compound. IARC has concluded that there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of hexavalent chromium compounds to humans. Despite considering the compound as carcinogenic A1, ACGIH has assigned zinc chromate a threshold limit value (TLV) of 0.01 mg/m(3) as a TWA for a normal 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek. We concur to ACGIH’s decision as this PEL value should protect workers from irritation and tissue ulceration as well as risk of lung cancer.

Animals acutely poisoned with zirconium show progressive depression and decreasing activity before death. Exposure to zirconium lactate or barium zirconate at airborne concentrations greater than 5 mg/m(3) produced severe, chronic, interstitial pneumonitis in laboratory animals. Daily 20-minute inhalation exposures to an unspecified concentration of the mist of sodium zirconium lactate for 6 weeks produced bronchial abscesses (with lobar pneumonia) or peribronchial granulomas in rabbit. Intensive (not further specified) exposure of rats to the dust of zirconium silicate for 7.5 months produced shadows on the lungs radiographically, but no histologic changes were seen in these animals at autopsy. Several inhalation studies involving animals of different species and exposure for 1 year either to zirconium oxide dust or zirconium tetrachloride mist (at a zirconium concentration of 3.5 mg/m3) measured mortality, weight changes, hematologic parameters, and urinary protein and found only slight decreases in hemoglobin and erythrocyte count in dogs exposed to high (6 mg/m3 zirconium) concentrations of zirconium tetrachloride; no histological changes were seen in these animals at autopsy. In another study, signs of diffuse interstitial pneumonitis with slight fibrogenic effects were seen in rats, guinea pigs and hamsters after an exposure of 5.4 mg/m3 of barium zirconate for 200 days.[20] In humans, contact of the skin with zirconium or zirconium compounds has caused skin granulomas in the form of linear streaks of small papules; the granulomas occurred after the application of deodorants containing sodium zirconium lactate or of cream containing zirconium oxide. Zirconium workers have also developed pulmonary granulomas after exposure to zirconium. Based on these observations, several institutions, including ACGIH has assigned zirconium and zirconium compounds (measured as zirconium) threshold limit values (TLVs) of 5 mg/m(3) as a TWA for a normal 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek and a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 10 mg/m(3) for periods not to exceed 15 minutes.
